# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project predicts stock closing prices using an **LSTM Deep Learning model**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Stock market prediction is a popular time-series forecasting problem.  
In this project, we use historical stock price data and apply an **LSTM Neural Network** to predict future closing prices.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Uses historical stock price dataset  
- Data preprocessing and scaling  
- Builds an LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras  
- Predicts future stock closing prices  
- Visualizes **Real vs Predicted Prices**

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  
- TensorFlow / Keras  

---

## 📊 Model Output

The model generates predictions and compares them with actual prices using a graph.

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Add technical indicators (RSI, Moving Average)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Deploy as a web app using Streamlit
